    <h1>WTFAWRY is a simple philosophy for building software fast.</h1>

    <p>
        And by software, I mean any form of project that needs to be completed.
        Forget AGILE, SCRUM, and other complicated stragies. WTFAWRY makes things simple.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Ask yourself <i>why the fuck aren't we released yet?</i></h3>
    <p>
        This is the most important step of WTFAWRY. Think of all the reasons that you
        can't deploy your project <i>right now</i> â€”Â buggy code, unfinished ideas, et cetera.
        What will your clients complain about? What did you envision that's missing from reality?
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Compile those reasons into a list.</h3>
    <p>
        Trello, JIRA, hell even a newly-created Discord channel will work.
        Just put all of those reasons that <i>your software hasn't shipped yet</i> into one, easy-to-access place.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fix those things.</h3>
    <p>
        Your goal is to finish the project.
        Now that you have a detailed step-by-step guide on <i>how</i> â€” your to-do list â€” you can begin your work.
        One by one, knock off all the issues and problems from that list. Eventually, there should be none left.
    </p>

    <p>If you still at this point find yourself unable to deploy your project, run through the three steps again. That's it. It's that simple.</p>

    <p>
        No more complicated design philosophies or lengthy project meetings on how to accomplish the project's goals.
        Now, whenever your coworkers ask what development principles you all should use, you can simply reply "WTFAWRY."
